##This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work about the ' run_analysis.R'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lables: read the file named 'activity_labels.txt', get the 'Links the class labels with their activity name'

subject_test: read the file named 'subject_test.txt', get the 'the subject who performed the activity'

X_test: read the file named 'X_test.txt', get the 'test set'

y_test: read the file named 'y_test.txt', get the 'test labels'

lab_test: join the y_test with the lables

ext_test: extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

###the following code/variables do the same things of 'train set'as above
#####X_train 
#####y_train
#####subject_train 
#####lab_train 
#####ext_train 

merge_data: merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

avg_data: creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

write.table(): create a txt file with write.table(), output the tidy data

###the following code use to test the 'avg_data'
#####list_act=split(avg_data,avg_data$act_name) 
#####write.table(list_act,"upload_list_act.txt",row.name=FALSE) 
#####list_sub=split(avg_data,avg_data$subject) 
#####write.table(list_sub,"upload_list_sub.txt",row.name=FALSE)
